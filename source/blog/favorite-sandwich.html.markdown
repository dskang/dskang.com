**Reflection**

This sandwich is the bomb. My version was pretty solid, but I’m going to miss eating the ones served at Frist in Princeton. Those sandwiches were incredible. <s>Also, this sandwich should have a simple name for it so that it’s easier to order. “Can I have the magic sandwich?” sounds so much better and is so much easier to say than “Can I have the tomato, mozzarella, and basil sandwich?” But I can’t have everything.</s> It’s called caprese.

Next time, I need to go buy some sourdough bread. Especially since the bread in our house has been in the freezer for god-knows-how-long. A random thought: I wonder how this would taste with Nutella…?
