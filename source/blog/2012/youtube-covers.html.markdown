Four years ago, I made my [first YouTube cover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUg5YmBXBWM). Since then, I’ve sporadically done several more covers and posted them to Facebook to fulfill my insatiable need for attention.

Up until now, I’ve simply used Photo Booth on my MacBook to record both the audio and the video. I decided to use GarageBand and iMovie in addition to Photo Booth this time around for my [I Kissed A Girl cover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ve7gsoSjSNA) just to play around with adding some basic effects to the audio in GarageBand.

Using all three programs to create a video turned out to be much harder than I expected it to be. After messing around for a while, I finally figured out how to create a synced video using video from Photo Booth and audio from GarageBand.

Here’s how I did it:

- Open up both Photo Booth and GarageBand at the same time. If you have a super old MacBook, this may be a problem for you and I am sorry.

- Press record in GarageBand. I like to start recording from GarageBand first because it lets me have Photo Booth up as I’m recording and I like looking at myself. Oh, and it also helps with syncing the audio later on.

- Press record in Photo Booth. The three beeps and the click will be recorded as part of the audio, and this is a good thing because it will make it easier to sync up the video with the audio later on. Make sure you’re shooting a video and not taking a photograph so you don’t end up with several awkward pictures of yourself. Yes, I speak from experience.

- Sing your heart out.
- When you have finished, stop recording in Photo Booth first and then stop recording in GarageBand. This is so that you don’t have to edit the video at all later on because the last 5 seconds are of you clicking your mouse or something equally as boring.
- Save your GarageBand clip, and save with iLife preview if it prompts you to do so. Your Photo Booth video should have automatically saved when you stopped recording.
- Open up iMovie. Trying to figure out how to use iMovie was pretty hard and unintuitive for me, but thankfully I’ve documented all my steps (with pictures!) below so you don’t have to go through the same suffering.

- You want to create a new Project and then create a new Event under File > New Event.
- Drag and drop your Photo Booth video on top of the new event that you’ve created. Dragging and dropping anywhere else does absolutely nothing. This is nonsense.

- The bottom half showing the imported video is the area where you edit the video before actually using it in your project. I mute the audio in the video (since I want to use the audio from GarageBand) before selecting the entire clip and dragging it into the working area (by default on the top left).

- If you click on the music icon on the right, you can import your song from GarageBand. Sometimes I’ll have to save the file in GarageBand, quit GarageBand, quit iMovie, and then open iMovie in order to the latest GarageBand file ready to use. It’s a pain in the ass. Just make sure that the GarageBand file that you’re importing is the newest one since the one listed in iMovie is not always the one you want. Drag your GarageBand file to the working area (the same area you dragged the muted clip).

- Now it’s time to sync the audio and the video. Click on the gear on the top left of your audio, and then select Clip Trimmer.

- Change the granularity of the audio clip so that you can trim it easier. Do that by adjusting the slider to ½ on the bottom right corner.

- In order to actually cut the audio from before the video started, you want to drag the yellow slider at the beginning of your clip to where you hear the loud click that indicates that Photo Booth is starting to record. Finding the three beeps and looking right around there makes this really easy. You want to drag the slider to that exact moment and then click Done to trim the audio. Don’t worry about messing up; you can fix the trimming later if needed.

- Now play your video, and see if the audio and video is in sync. If it is, fantastic! We can get to exporting the video and uploading it to YouTube. If not, keep messing around with the Clip Trimmer to get the audio synced up just right.
- iMovie comes with the ability to upload directly to YouTube, but if you use two-factor authentication with your Google account (you should), the YouTube upload feature won’t work. You’ll have to export the video manually and then upload it to YouTube through the website itself.
- You’re done! Share your video with friends and also with me!
