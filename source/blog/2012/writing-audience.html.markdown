title: Who are you writing for?

Ever since I started blogging, I’ve always written for an audience – the audience being my friends and the Hacker News crowd. However, writing for an audience means that I’m always second-guessing myself before publishing a post.

“Does what I’m saying make sense?”

“Will people agree?”

“Do I care whether people agree or not?”

As I talked about in my previous post on [being wrong](/being-wrong), it’s hard to come up with an opinion and not be afraid to look stupid. Even since making that post, I’m not producing as much as I want to be. I’m making blog posts very infrequently, and the reason is because I’m still writing for an audience and I’m not very comfortable doing so.

While my eventual goal is to produce a lot of great content for an external audience, I’m going to take this one step at a time. The first step being the process of creating content itself. To do this, I will be producing content not for anyone else, but for myself. Because that’s easiest to do. I expect to write posts with an external audience in mind from time to time, but most of my posts will be written just for my benefit.

My goal, until I feel perfectly at ease with producing content for others, is to produce content for myself on a regular basis. In that vein, I’ve also migrated my blog from Jekyll to Tumblr. *[Update (2017): This post was migrated from Tumblr to Middleman.]* As much as I love having all my content under version control and being able to create a new post with ‘git push’, blogging via Jekyll has way too much friction. I want to remove as much friction as I can so that I will post more, and so I will be blogging with Tumblr. And since my intended audience will be myself, I’m no longer going to make posts solely about tech – they will be about whatever I feel like talking about at the time.

Here’s to consistent blogging.
