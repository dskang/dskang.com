“Don’t be too shocked”  
I brace for the worst  
“She talked about horses”  
I brace for the worst

That familiar stench  
Sterile death  
I see her in the distance  
The lone, lying figure in a crowded room

She turns  
No words  
Just pain in her eyes  
Mouth opens  
No words  
Just pain in her eyes

Does she see?  
Does she understand?  
…  
Does she know who I am?

But a skeleton  
“She weighs 80 pounds”  
Skin and bones  
Skin and bones

Grandfather, sister, and I  
We speak  
We crack jokes  
We laugh  
No response

A shell
