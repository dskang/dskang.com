I met Anthony while making an impulse run to In-N-Out. He was hungry, so we grabbed food together. Anthony walked with a limp; he had shattered the entire left side of his body while blackout drunk from drinking and taking Xanax at the same time and jumping off a bridge four stories high. Note to self: donâ€™t drink and take Xanax at the same time.
