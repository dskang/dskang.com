Today I want to share my desktop background with you.

The name of the image above is “Pale Blue Dot” and it was taken by a spacecraft in 1990 from a distance of 3.7 billion miles from Earth. If you want to learn more about the image and Carl Sagan’s extremely eloquent reflections on it, check out this [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pale_Blue_Dot).

Look closely at that image. In the upper right quadrant, you’ll see a small dot in the orangish beam. That’s Earth. That’s you. That’s me. That’s us. That’s all of our problems. That’s all of human history.

I love looking at this picture because it really puts our lives into perspective; you begin to realize just how utterly small and insignificant we are in the scheme of the entire universe.

One of my hopes for the near future is that the technology for space travel will significantly advance to the point where it’ll be safe and affordable for everyday civilians to view Earth from outside Earth just as astronauts have. I think the world would be a better place if people could see that we’re truly all in this together. It’s too easy to lose sight of that.
