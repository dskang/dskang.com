I made this on 8/25, the night before my flight from San Francisco to Orange Country, but I wanted to post this now to make sure that I keep track of everything that I cook in one place. This is the first real meal that I’ve cooked for myself (ramen doesn’t count) and it was delicious. Especially because I made it.
