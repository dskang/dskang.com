I almost died today.

As our white station wagon rounded the bend, a yellow cab appeared in front, and I mean right in front, headed straight for us. There was a momentary pause, then a blaring horn, then a sudden swerve into the right, both positionally and legally, lane. It slowly dawned on us that our lives could have ended right then and there. You know what went through my mind as that yellow cab manifested, surely the last thing I would see before being blasted away into oblivion?

Nothing.
