There’s a grandma to the right of my own  
Also lies in bed all day  
Been there for three years now  
She sleeps

I come in early afternoon  
She is sleeping  
I leave in the evening  
She is sleeping

Never have I seen her open her eyes  
Never have I heard her speak  
She is trapped inside her body  
Eternal slumber

Alive but not living  
She exists without purpose  
What difference does it make to be alive or dead?  
What right do I have to say that?

Her daughter visits twice or thrice a week  
A middle aged lady who speaks in semi-broken English  
She has three children, a son who’s a sophomore at UCI  
Her own life to live

A special assistant comes daily to feed the sleeper  
Shoving spoonfuls of mush into her mouth  
Constantly yelling “Mommy! Mommy!”  
It annoys the hell out of me

Why does the feeder speak to the sleeper?  
The sleeper cannot hear her  
Much less comprehend her Spanish  
And yet she talks and talks and talks

The daughter enters during a feeding session  
The feeder pries open the eyes of the sleeper  
What? Why?  
“Esta su hija! Esta su hija!”

Why? Why does she do this?  
Does she expect the sleeper to respond?  
The feeder continues her yelling  
The sleeper continues her slumber

I am trapped  
Eternal nightmare
