I had an unbelievable night and felt inspired to write a poem:

I was in bed all alone when I heard her come on in  
I knew she wanted a night of bloodlust, debauchery, and sin  
I pulled my covers over, said I wanted to be alone  
She approached anyway and said this was now her home  
I opened my eyes to see her but there was no hint of light  
I recalled her by her voice, fresh from her visit last night  
I told her to go away, I had to wake for work at five  
She whispered that without me she couldn't feel alive  
I fought off her approaches but gave up with a heavy sigh  
I lay motionless and tried to sleep as she proceeded to suck me dry  
She kept me up all night, well past half past three  
I fucking hate my life -- midnight mosquito and me
