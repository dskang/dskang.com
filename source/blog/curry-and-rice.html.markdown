High off my great success at cooking spaghetti, I wanted to continue on in my journey to become Boss Chef DK. This time, Michelle and I decided to cook together at the same time. But how, you ask? We crossed the three hour time zone difference and the thousands of miles of separation through the power of the Internet. Google Hangouts was our weapon of choice, and she taught me how to not cut off my fingers while slicing vegetables (curl your fingers inwards so that your knuckles protrude further out) and pretty much how to not blow up my kitchen while cooking. If you’re in a long distance relationship, you should try this sometime. It’s really fun.

Goal:

- Curry and rice that can reasonably be considered edible

Ingredients:

- Rice
- 2 large potatoes
- 1 whole onion
- 3 carrots
- Curry mix (I used Vermont Curry)

Instructions:
- Dice the vegetables into cubes. Try not to cut off any of your fingers.
- Put everything into a pot and fill it up with water until the water almost covers everything but not quite. This part was really hard.
- Boil until the potatoes taste like potatoes. Don’t ask me what this means.
- Break up the curry packet into pieces and add to your pot.
- Stir.
- Wait.
- Stir.
- Tada!

Result:

- 6 servings of the best curry ever. Actually, there was this Thai place in SF that made absolutely boss coconut milk curry but that’s not important.

Cutting vegetables is hard work. But seriously, you guys.

Dude, I even made my own rice. Come at me bro.

So, so good.

Reflection:

- Both my brother and my sister were really impressed that I made my own rice. I’m proud but I feel like a fraud because all I did was rinse the rice, add some water, and put everything in the rice cooker. I’ll take the credit though.
- The water took forever to boil, and I think it was because the pot was off-center.
- I need to put in fewer vegetables next time. It is way too chunky. Still delicious, though.
- I should take a picture of the ingredients before cooking from now on.
- The fan inside my MacBook Air goes crazy when I have Google Hangouts running. Anyone know what exactly causes this?
- Eating the food I make is deeply satisfying. Eating food in general is pretty darn satisfying.
