    I gain consciousness in Seoul, Korea. One of the great unsolved problems in computer vision is being able to identify whether a picture is of me as a baby or a large potato.

    My parents send my siblings and me to live with my grandparents in the promised land of California. I successfully make my first friend in America and blossom into a social butterfly with lots of pointing and three words: "You. Me. Friend?"

    Here's where I tell you that my story gets fairly dark but I pinky promise that it will get better.

    My brother and sister stay with my grandparents while I move in with my uncle and aunt. Unfortunately, they don't actually want me and turn out to be physically and emotionally abusive for the two years I live with them.

    My mom and dad tell us they will visit America for Christmas in 1999. Some time before the trip, my dad starts saying that my mom is too tired to talk when I ask for her on the phone. When the trip happens, he arrives alone, gathers our family members, and breaks the news that my mom died from breast cancer. I cry and cry but no one else does because everyone had known for a while.

    I share these personal events because they've made me who I am today, and I've long since discovered that openness and vulnerability creates strength. They are also a source of immense gratitude: When I look back on this period of my life and reflect on losing my mom in the midst of being beaten, kicked out of the house, and abandoned by my uncle and aunt, I can't help but be thankful that I came out of it intact.

    I reach the peak of my creative life as a 5th grader:

    I start a publication called "Imagination Comix" under which I create numerous comic books ranging from a choose-your-own-adventure stick figure spy series to one about a sheep named Famula.

    I develop my own trading cards called "Marble Monsters", hold contests for crowdsourcing monster ideas from classmates, and hire a few friends to print out cards from their home printers by paying them a dollar each. Andy writes me a letter saying that his mom wouldn't let him use the printer and asks if we can still be friends. I ignore him for the rest of the year. Just kidding. Or am I?

    I sell my own currency called "Funny Money" which are strips of paper with gold glitter that kids could exchange for snacks from Korean supermarkets during break. I'm told this was a felony.

    A song cover that I post on YouTube gets popular (now at 100,000+ views from 130+ countries) and I discover how amazing the Internet is for reaching people from all around the world. I also learn that I have a special gift for curing racism: "Dude I was going to be racist and make fun of your slanty little asian eyes till you started to sing, and your voice doesn't suck like the girl I watched before this video, so... Good job?ï»¿" (YouTube comment, 2008)

    I find myself staring at an orange tiger with CONGRATULATIONS! written beneath it and have a hard time believing that I got accepted to Princeton. When I tell my grandparents, they don't believe me. Super not cool.

    I land a software engineering internship at Facebook after my freshman year and fall in love with the tech world. The experience is exhilarating: I make real money for the first time; I meet amazingly talented and passionate people; a big, scary competitor (Google+) launches and the energy at Facebook is palpable. I also learn that the "Facebook Fifteen" is not a joke when I gain a ton of weight from the free food.
