    I gain consciousness in Seoul, Korea. One of the great unsolved problems in computer vision is being able to identify whether a picture is of me as a baby or a large potato.

    My parents send my siblings and me to live with my grandparents in the promised land of California. I successfully make my first friend in America and spontaneously combust into a social butterfly with lots of pointing and three words: "You. Me. Friend?"

    This is where my story gets fairly dark. It gets better, I promise.

    My brother and sister stay with my grandparents while I move in with my uncle and aunt. Unfortunately, they don't actually want me and turn out to be physically and emotionally abusive for the two years I live with them.

    During this period, my mom and dad say they're planning on visiting us in the States for the first time. Some time before the planned trip, my dad starts telling me that my mom is too tired to talk whenever I ask for her on the phone. When the trip happens, he arrives alone, gathers our family members, and breaks the news: breast cancer killed my mom. I cry and cry but no one else does because everyone had known for a while.

    I share these personal events because they've made me who I am today, and I've long since discovered that openness and vulnerability creates strength. They are also a source of immense gratitude: When I look back on this period of my life and reflect on losing my mom in the midst of being beaten, kicked out of the house, and abandoned by relatives who were entrusted with caring for me, I can't help but be thankful that I somehow made it out okay.

    I reach the peak of my creative life as a 5th grader:

    I start a publication called Imagination Comix under which I create numerous comic books ranging from a choose-your-own-adventure stick figure spy series to one about a sheep named Famula.

    I develop my own trading cards called Marble Monsters, hold contests for crowdsourcing monster ideas from classmates, and hire a few friends to print out cards from their home printers by paying them a dollar each. Andy writes me a letter saying that his mom wouldn't let him use the printer and asks if we can still be friends. I ignore him for the rest of the year. Just kidding.

    I sell my own currency called Funny Money which are strips of paper with gold glitter that could be exchanged for snacks from Korean supermarkets. I'm told this was a felony.

    A song cover that I post on YouTube gets popular (now at 100,000+ views from 130+ countries) and I discover how amazing the Internet is for reaching people from all around the world. I also learn about my special power for curing racism: "Dude I was going to be racist and make fun of your slanty little asian eyes till you started to sing, and your voice doesn't suck like the girl I watched before this video, so... Good job?ï»¿" (YouTube comment, 2008)

    I find myself staring in disbelief at the screen with an orange tiger and CONGRATULATIONS! written beneath it. When I excitedly tell my grandparents that I got into Princeton, they nonchalantly continue watching TV because they don't believe me. When I finally convince them, I start to wish I hadn't because they think this is big enough news to publish in the local Korean newspaper and I tell them that's ridiculous. It gets published.

    I work as a software engineering intern at Facebook after my freshman year and fall in love with the tech world. The summer is magical and full of many firsts: making real money, working with amazingly talented and accomplished people, and learning that free gourmet food can be a bad thing when I experience the "Facebook Fifteen" firsthand and gain a ton of weight.

    I consider returning to Facebook but decide to use my internships to maximize my exposure to a variety of experiences and join Twilio in San Francsico. I learn what it's like to work at a startup, especially the part where you get really good at ping pong.

  age: 20
  date: 2012 &ndash; 2013
  description: >-
    I take a year off from school because my grandma's health is deteriorating and it becomes clear she will soon pass away. I spend time with her in the beginning of the year, move to Silicon Valley to build the next world-changing iPhone app and quickly realize it's not going to happen, briefly work as a street fundraiser for the Red Cross and learn the fearlessness that comes from getting rejected for 8 hours a day, then fall in love with traveling when I take a leap of faith and venture on a solo backpacking trip around 13 countries in Europe.

    I become a hackNY Fellow and code at a startup called Crowdtap by day while exploring New York and eating a ton of Artichoke Pizza with the other hackNY Fellows by night.

    My previous three software engineering internships convince me that at this point, I know what it's like to work as a software engineer. I look for a role where I can focus on figuring out what should be built and why, rather than the implementation details. I intern as an Associate Product Manager at Google in Seattle and instantly fall in love with stealing credit from engineers.

graduation:

  title: Graduation
  age: 22
  date: 2015
  description: >-
    I graduate from Princeton and backpack around Asia over the summer when I get sick nasty abs because I literally get sick from drinking contaminated Vietnamese coffee and my body refuses to digest anything for a week. When I get back, I join Google as a full-time Associate Product Manager in Mountain View where I specialize in looking busy while actually just eating snacks all the time.

  age: 23

  description: >-
    A psilocybin experience blows my mind in the most wonderful way and it leads to a fascination with consciousness and altered states. That experience and Sam Harris's work convince me that there is value in spirituality and that it can be approached in a rational way whereas I had previously rejected it categorically as superstition. I start meditating regularly and attend a week-long silent retreat in Spirit Rock where I cultivate a deeper appreciation for mindfulness and spiritual practice.

  age: 23
  date: 2016
  description: >-
    In 2011, I took a course by Peter Singer at Princeton called Practial Ethics that convinced me that modern meat consumption is unethical due to the immense suffering it creates for animals. I subsequently became pescatarian but started eating meat in 2013 despite still believing that it was unethical. In 2016, I decide to live more congruently with my ethical values and become vegetarian.

  age: 24

    I realize that working at a multinational company like Google provides the unique opportunity to live in a different country and learn about other cultures and perspectives. Tokyo was amazing when I visited after graduation so I decide to move there and see what life is like on the other side of the world. So far, it's pretty dope.
