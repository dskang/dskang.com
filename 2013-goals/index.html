    <h2>Goals for 2013</h2>
    <span class="entry-date">January  1, 2013</span>
  </div>
  <p>I’ve always felt weird making New Year’s resolutions because I tend to think of my life in stages (e.g. college freshman year, sophomore year, year off, etc.) that don’t fall neatly into one year segments that start on January 1st and end on December 31st, but having set start and end dates makes it really convenient to measure progress on set goals.</p>

<p>In that spirit, I’m going to set some goals for different aspects of my life for 2013 with using the following criteria:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Each goal must be challenging yet realistic. I usually tend to be way too aggressive with my goals and not reach them, and this time I want to actually try setting realistic expectations.</li>
  <li>Each goal must be concrete and easily measurable so that I can gauge my progress and evaluate how successful I was in accomplishing my goals by the end of the year. No vague statements like “I want to be more outgoing/become a better designer/eat healthier/etc.”</li>
  <li>Each goal must be sufficiently dependent on myself so that I can’t make excuses.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Blogging</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Write at least 150 posts (~1 post every 2.5 days)<br />
<em>2012 comparison: 83 posts, however, many were drawings</em></li>
  <li>Attract over 100,000 unique visitors<br />
<em>2012 comparison: 29,478 unique visitors</em></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Reading</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Read at least 25 books (~1 book every 2 weeks)<br />
<em>2012 comparison: I didn’t keep track, but I’m thinking around 10-15 books.</em></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Photography</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Take at least 365 photos (1 photo every day)<br />
<em>2012 comparison: ~300 photos</em></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Fitness</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Bench press at least 140 pounds<br />
<em>2012 comparison: none. I took the goal weight from this <a href="http://www.exrx.net/Testing/WeightLifting/BenchStandards.html">bench strength standards table</a> since I don’t have any personal point of reference.</em></li>
  <li>Squat at least 190 pounds<br />
<em>2012 comparison: none. I took the goal weight from this <a href="http://www.exrx.net/Testing/WeightLifting/SquatStandards.html">squat strength standards table</a> since I don’t have any personal point of reference.</em></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>People</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Make at least 250 new friends. Since this is hard to keep track of, I’ll be using the number of friends added as provided by Facebook. As long as I don’t indiscriminately add everybody and their mom, this number should be pretty accurate.<br />
<em>2012 comparison: 233 new friends</em></li>
</ul>

<p>I’ll be adding onto this list as I think of other goals I’d like to accomplish along with the date on which they were added.</p>
