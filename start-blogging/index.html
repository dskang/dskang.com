<p>Writing is hard for me. I stumble over my words, I agonize over whether a sentence makes sense to people other than myself, I delete and rewrite and delete again. Thoughts that make perfect sense in my head never seem to come out right on paper.</p>

<p>In the past couple days, multiple people have told me that they want to start blogging. There are many excuses for why they haven’t started already:</p>

<p>“I don’t write well.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid of what others will think of me.”</p>

<p>“I can’t get the content to come out right.”</p>

<p>I understand and can relate to these reasons, because they’re all things that I personally struggle with. There’s only one solution to these problems: just write.</p>

<p>Over time, your writing will get better. Hell, that’s a big part of why I write. I want to become a better communicator, and the ability to write well is absolutely crucial. I have some friends who are powerful writers, and whenever I read their writing I envy their ability to communicate their thoughts and feelings so clearly and beautifully. I strive to express myself as well as they do. If your lack of ability to write well is the only thing holding you back, it’s important to recognize that your writing will not one day magically get better – like most things, it requires practice.</p>

<p>If you’ve read through my previous posts, you know that I’ve struggled a lot with being afraid of how others will judge me because of my writing. Over time, I’ve come to accept that I most definitely will be wrong and say dumb things. It’s a part of life. I’m growing as a person, and it’s ridiculous to think that in a couple years I’ll agree with everything I believe today. I still struggle with the fear of being wrong and judged, but embracing the fact that it is an inevitable part of my personal development helps a lot. For me, always staying silent and never expressing myself due to fear of judgment seems much worse than occasionally saying something stupid and learning from the experience. I hope you feel the same way.</p>

<p>One benefit of writing that I was surprised to discover is that it helps me understand how I feel about a topic or issue. I always believed that writing would merely help me express my fully formed thoughts and opinions, but in fact I’ve found that my ideas will develop and change during the writing process. The process of putting my thoughts on paper helps me evaluate my thoughts in a new and different light than if I were just trapped in my own head. It’s quite strange, really.</p>

<p>Maybe you’ve always wanted to start a blog but never did. What’s stopping you? Maybe you have a post written up but haven’t published because it’s “not good enough”. It’s good enough. The important thing is to start, and there’s no better time than now.</p>
