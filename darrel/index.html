    <h2>“I’ll take you to Nashville sometime”</h2>

  </div>
  <p>Darrel was a stutterer. The man in front of me had just brushed right past him, and now he was looking straight at me.</p>

<p>“Hey, I’m not from the city and I’d like to go to Burger King.”</p>

<p>I entertained the idea that he was asking for directions, but he was clearly looking for an act of kindness.</p>

<p>“Sure, let’s go.”</p>

<p>Darrel looked at me, almost in disbelief, and decided that he needed to clarify the point that I had entertained a moment earlier. There’s snot dripping out of his right nostril.</p>

<p>“I just need a couple dollars for food and I’d really appreciate it if –”</p>

<p>“Yup. Let’s go.”</p>

<p>And we’re off.</p>

<p>“I’ve been out and haven’t eaten since 7:30am. Tourists don’t understand homeless.”</p>

<p>Darrel had grown up in Nashville and had stayed in LA before heading up to San Francisco. I told him that I would have stayed in LA because I don’t know how I’d stand the cold here. He insisted that all the free thinkers live in San Francisco and that’s where he needs to be.</p>

<p>We’ve arrived.</p>

<p>Darrel approaches the young black girl behind the register, and glances at the menu.</p>

<p>“I’d like a - a - one of those - chicken -”</p>

<p>“Chicken sandwich?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Spicy chicken sandwich?”</p>

<p>“No. A - ”</p>

<p>“Chicken tenders?”</p>

<p>It goes on like this for a couple minutes, and I’m just standing there, blown away by several things: Darrel’s pickiness despite not having eaten all day, the counter girl’s patience, and mostly the sheer number of different chicken offerings at Burger King.</p>

<p>Eventually, Darrel seems to have come to a decision. Kind of.</p>

<p>“What’s the difference between the basil and the parmesan? What does the basil have?”</p>

<p>“The basil has… basil.”</p>

<p>“No, no, the parmesan.”</p>

<p>The girl is obviously frustrated now. She mutters under her breath, “Every. Day.”</p>

<p>“I’ll get the parmesan special. With extra parmesan.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you want to consult with the person making the purchase?”</p>

<p>Disdain drips from her voice.</p>

<p>I reassure her that it’s fine, and Darrel turns to me.</p>

<p>“Is it- is it okay if I get two?”</p>

<p>I don’t know how much a sandwich costs, but I figure it’s Burger King and how much could a sandwich here cost anyway so why the hell not.</p>

<p>“Sure.”</p>

<p>“That’ll be $10.81.”</p>

<p>Wow. What the hell? What are these sandwiches made of? I pay anyway.</p>

<p>We’re waiting now, and Darrel tries to talk politics. He has extremely thick glasses that give him an old, knowing look, but the rest of his appearance easily override that image.</p>

<p>“Republicans have it made, you know? They’re all rich. They don’t understand what it’s like for folks like us.”</p>

<p>I reassure him that not all Republicans are rich, greedy, white millionaires living in fat mansions. He is genuinely surprised.</p>

<p>The food comes out, and we’re outside. I hand Darrel the bag with his food, but I’m dying to see what this $5 sandwich looks like. Darrel peels back the wrapping, and it looks like what I originally expected: a sorry excuse for a sandwich. I’m disappointed. Ten dollars could have bought him a lot more, not to mention healthier, food.</p>

<p>Darrel and I stand chatting a bit more, and he tells me that he’ll take me to Nashville sometime. I wish I could believe him. I ask him where he’s going. He apparently has a place that he rents on a weekly basis.</p>

<p>“How do you get the money to pay for it?”</p>

<p>Darrel smiles.</p>

<p>“From people like you.”</p>
