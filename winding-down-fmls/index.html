  <p>To the 30 of you who continue to visit ptonfml.com daily despite the fact that there has been no new content for weeks:</p>

<p>Thanks. I appreciate the love and support, but it’s time to pull the plug on an operation that’s been dead for quite some time now. Frankly, I’m getting sick of the spam comments of “penis” this and “vagina’ that. I know the troll doing that is one of the dedicated 30 visitors, so I’m going to take this opportunity to tell you that you should be ashamed of yourself. Just kidding; I’m bit of a jokester myself, so I understand where you’re coming from. You should really step it up and try to pursue higher levels in the art of trolling, though. Penis jokes got old in junior high.</p>

<p>Now to the rest of you. The 29 of you that are decent, hard-working, caring Princetonians. Raymond, a close friend and the man behind <a href="http://princetonfml.com/">princetonfml.com</a>, will take good care of you, so throw away your fears and venture down yonder.</p>

<p>This has been a fun journey, and I’m glad you guys got to share in it with me. In case you haven’t noticed, this is my personal blog. Feel free to follow me so that you can join me in my future adventures. Reach out to me if you want to grab a cup of coffee or a meal sometime, although I imagine it’ll be pretty difficult with me being in San Francisco and all. Maybe I’ll visit Princeton in the spring when the snow fades away and campus starts being inhabitable again. Who knows.</p>

<p>Until then, here’s a screenshot of the most popular posts on the site for memory’s sake:</p>

<p>P.S. To "A Boy Named James”: Love you, man. Thanks for stepping up and doing this with me.</p>
