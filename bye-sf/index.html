<p>Today’s my last day in SF before I take a bus (yes, again) back to LA, spend two weeks at home, then fly to London for a backpacking trip across Europe.</p>

<p>San Francisco has been a wonderful place to live in since I moved here back in October, and I can’t wait to eventually come back and beat all the other startups in achieving world domination. This is assuming that this summer with HackNY doesn’t make me fall hopelessly in love with NYC. We’ll see.</p>

<p>Alright, let’s talk about SF.</p>

<p><strong>My Two Favorite Things</strong></p>

<p>1. There are so many things to do!!!1111!ONE</p>

<p>Back in Fullerton, my hometown, there is the constant question of “so what do you want to do?” And this is due less to a lack of decision-making skills than it is to the lack of choices. If there were a tenth of the amount of things to do in Fullerton as there are in SF, I’d be ecstatic.</p>

<p>San Francisco is filled with tourist hotspots, museums, parks, and many other attractions, and on top of that there are events happening all the time. I found out about Funcheap a long month into living here, and it’s been an invaluable resource since for finding exciting things to do around the city. If this is your first time hearing about Funcheap, you’re welcome.</p>

<p>I actually really enjoy doing touristy activities because they’re usually lots of fun. After all, there are good reasons why these places attract tourists. And sometimes, I discover something new despite having been to a particular place a million times: I was walking around Pier 39 and found this “7-D” attraction where you sit down and shoot zombies on a big screen while your chair vibrates and blows air into your face to simulate wind, and it was a lot of fun because I kicked ass. Or maybe my partner just sucked and made me look good in comparison. Let’s just assume it’s the former.</p>

<p>2. There are a lot of weird people here. Weird is good. Weird is fun.</p>

<p>There’s no short of interesting characters here. From the naked guy walking around with his wang hanging out dressed as Jesus on Halloween (yes, of course this was in the Castro) to the guy who’s been holding a neon-green “Jesus Loves You” sign nearly every day for the past 12 years, the people here have such diverse backgrounds and lifestyles. I still remember meeting this girl when I first moved here in front of In-N-Out who told me that she likes to look into people’s windows at night with a telescope. The fun (and kind of scary) thing is that quirky people like this are not at all hard to find.</p>

<p><strong>My Two Least Favorite Things</strong></p>

<p>1. It’s cold.</p>

<p>I’m a wimp when it comes to cold temperatures. (Yay for going to Europe in February!) Sometimes I’ll look outside my window, see that it’s sunny, and step outside in a t-shirt. Then I’ll sprint back up the stairs and grab my thickest jacket because it’s below 70 degrees. Discount this “bad thing” if you live anywhere other than Southern California. I apologize in advance for my invalid complaint.</p>

<p>2. The hills are rough. In the beginning.</p>

<p>I live on top of a large hill, and I thought I was going to faint the first couple times I walked home after a day out. After a couple months of climbing Mount Powell-Everest, my legs have adjusted and I end up only half about to faint. Also, this really isn’t a bad thing as it’s pretty good exercise. That said, I would hate to drive here.</p>

<p>There’s a lot more I can write about San Francisco, but I actually need to go pack or else I’ll miss my bus tomorrow and end up staying here involuntarily in the streets. I’m sure I’d experience San Francisco in a very different light. Speaking of which, I actually want to try living in the streets for a week or so, but that’s for another time. Toodles.</p>
